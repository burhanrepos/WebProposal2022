        <p>Craps is a dice game in which players bet on the outcomes of a pair of dice. Players can wager money against each other (playing "street craps") or against a bank ("casino craps"). Because it requires little equipment, "street craps" can be played in informal settings. While shooting craps, players may use slang terminology to place bets and actions.</p>

                            o In today’s day and age, online shopping is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the COVID-19
                                crisis, where people became stranded inside of their homes, online shopping came out as an only solution. As
                                the automated nature of the phenomenon, the need for a strong, well thought-out and reliable database arose
                                owing to storing the data of the customers, their orders and the products any of the businesses sell.
                                Therefore our database stores the data of all the necessary Entities involved in online shopping. As the
                                nature of this software is online-based, the possibility of a manual data entry system becomes unviable, not
                                to mention all the problems that follow the manual data entry system.

                        <p> o Local Delivery Management System is designed to accommodate delivery businesses in which customers have a
                            regular “standing order” that may be modified or placed on hold from time to time. Because the Local Delivery
                            Management System was designed for home delivery businesses that are based on the standing order, we have
                            avoided the “shopping cart” functionality common to many ecommerce-type software packages. The shopping cart
                            pattern has some inherent problems when used for a standing order business, and the Local Delivery Management
                            System handles these types of recurring sales transactions much better than shopping cart-based software
                            solutions.</p>
